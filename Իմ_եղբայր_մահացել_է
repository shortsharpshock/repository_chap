// Իմ եղբայր մահացել է 

// and the BBEG is coming from inside the house 
// and the body nearly begs to be looted 
// and I've looked at a few corpses in my life 
// of course I had classmates who died 
// it looms so close 
// it weaves us closed 
// and I can't recant the impossible assay 
// I never sent him a letter 
// I only know his middle name because it's the same 
// name as my second father 
// and farther now than ever 
// does his son still see it 
// does the body root his memories 
// and how well do roots remember 
// what it is to be the recipient 
// to inherit trembling flesh 
// and his wife 
// and her blood-splattered glasses 
// her life made amorphous glass 
// or maybe she was fumbling unseeing 
// it was early 
// or it was late 
// anyway it had always been 
// coming 
// the call 
// from inside the head 
// a boy becomes a man becomes a hole 
// becomes a home 
// every nigga is synecdochic 
// all the names we share 
// all the same holes holding 
// hands down 
// did his hands shake 
// did his hands shake all the time 
// a phantom vibration 
// a grave is a pocket that buzzes when it calls 
// I hear the call 
// I take my pills 
// I don't pay the bill 
// we once were babies with blood 
// on our breath 
// capillaries clawing from our lungs 
// my dead father is a hot metal memory 
// my brother is dead and 
// I can only grieve him 
// in a new tongue 
// a favorite sun 
// there is a flaming son inside me 
// a son is the afterimage of his father's suffering 
// a son is the light of his father's shrinking 
// I'd go shrieking to the cemetery 
// if I knew where any of my blood was buried
