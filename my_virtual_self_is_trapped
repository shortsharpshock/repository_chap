// my virtual self is trapped in a gym

what is the feeling of being watched and never seen?

i am walking with my partner and their dog and we are a secret compact i tell myself i don't care if they know
but black gravel crackles underneath slow tires sound like impending fireworks
some kid will lose a finger or a hand or a face this summer 
it's so hot there's a man hanging himself the next town over
i suspect everyone in a city like this.
once a sister saw me at the movies with a man i loved and asked me at the hall in front of everyone
i make no mistakes about earshot, the word we use when there's a threat of being heard
i would not call it stalking, but yes, i was followed
when the opportunity arose. there was no stakeout 
but only because my congregation could not conceive of pleasure between two women,
though neither of us were women. i still passed then. i still do. it is a safeguard
to let christians see what they want to see. sometimes you have to let men think they know you.
i have a mirror mouth and i don't look
at the sun. the light will betray me. someone's saying that the light is everywhere
and they are sadly mistaken--if we were creatures of brightness you'd have noticed me glinting.

no, i was not a safe person to love. 
inside: a catastrophe of programs. three desktops of obsolete filetypes. 
this was my triune god. 
i was crashing everywhere there was space. 
i could've gone back at any moment. a time machine to an old self trapped 
in a gym.
