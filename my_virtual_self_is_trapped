black gravel underneath slow tires 
sounds like impending fireworks.
some kid will lose a finger or a hand or a face 
this summer. 

i suspect everyone in a city like this, 
where a sister once saw me at the movies 
with a man i loved and asked me 
about him at the hall in front of everyone.
i make no mistakes about earshot, the threat of being heard.
i have known too many women who fear their own footfalls
to be cheap with my words. so i would not call 
it stalking, but yes, i was followed
when the opportunity arose. there was no stakeout 
but only because my congregation could not 
conceive of pleasure between two women,
though neither of us were women. 

i still passed then. i still do. it is a safeguard
to let some christians see what they want to see. 
sometimes you have to let men think they know you.
do you know I told three elders in their 50s 
the details of the first dick I let enter me?
i had a mirror mouth and i couldn't look
at the sun. the light would betray me. 

no, i was not a safe person
to love. inside: a catastrophe of programs. 
three desktops of obsolete filetypes, my triune god. 
i crashed everywhere there was space.  
home is a row of love-worn keys
placed under the welcome mat of a house
moments before itâ€™s snatched by flames.
