// my virtual self is trapped in a gym

I can't make this part faster.
There's a version of you that escapes
the house, the country
for a while. There is no circumstance
of fate dragging you back home. One day
you will be grateful to have been here.

I want to tell you a story while you 
cry into your fists doing push-ups
to Drake songs.  

Your heart is not wrong. You aren't some
broken swan or the memory of a song. You are 
because you are. We are never having children
but we are learning to mother ourselves.
Someone will love the self you are hiding from,
and that someone will be me. 

I still feel you in our apartment, moping around.
It's okay if you need to cry it out.
Do you know I just saw you sleep
for the first time? The most restless version of me
and you are finally at rest 
sometimes. 

I know you feel all danger, no delivery. 
You follow through on things that are bad for you, 
which is really just your brain trying to generate movement
by licking a live wire. You are not broken.
You are starving. 

I am sorry to say that your mother-in-law will die
two years after you meet her. It will nearly destroy you,
and then, miraculously, it won't. This will be the first death
you don't divest from. You are growing. It will hurt.
