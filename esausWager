I used to be a war before I knew 
my beauty wouldn't protect me.
I'm the sunrise supplanting the prodigal daughter.
Even people who hate me call me conjurer,
resent me now that I know how to eat.

My child self arrives in a dream 
with her hand out, mouth open. 
The only birthright I need:
Plain lays bathed in Louisiana hot sauce
Pop tarts + pork chops + chicharrones 
Toaster strudels w/o prophylactic prevacid
Hungry Jack potato flakes 
Stolen Crispix + blue koolaid
Corn tomato bacon over minute rice
Sink scrubbed collards + cabbage cooked brown
Marshmallow mateys + Mahatma gold foil turmeric grains 
Pecan spinwheels + honey buns 

Cinnamon sugar toast with butter 


Aisle by aisle we scan the commissary, 
starved for safe pleasure. An adolescence of deceptions
stole fullness from me. [what deception?]
If I could stay in the car, sweating in the parking lot,
I would. Instead, I don my headphones and offer my hand.
"You are already this brave," I tell her. Our palms sweat
into each other.
