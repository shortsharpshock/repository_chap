My child self arrives in a dream 
with her hand out, mouth open. 
She demands her birthright:
Plain lays blobbed blood orange in Louisiana hot sauce
Circle K Pop tarts + chicharrones from the PX
Toaster strudels w/o prophylactic prevacid
Hungry Jack potato flakes expanding in heat and wet
Stolen Crispix + blue koolaid the way we used to make it
Corn tomato bacon medley over minute rice
Sink scrubbed collards + cabbage cooked brown
Marshmallow mateys + Mahatma gold foil turmeric grains 
Pecan spinwheels + honey buns warmed for 8 seconds exactly

I was a famine before I knew 
my beauty wouldn't protect me.
I'm the smorgasbord supplanting 
the prodigal daughter.
Even people who hate me call me conjurer,
resent me now that I consume more than 
I am consumed. I have locked my appetite
between my hairy legs. I am red with delight.

I feed her, and eat, and eat, and
aisle by aisle we scan the commissary, 
starved for safe pleasure. I know our belly-deep deceiptions.
If I could stay in the car, sweating in the parking lot,
I would. Instead, I don my headphones and offer my hand.
"You are already this brave," I tell her. 
Our palms sweat sweet 
into each other.
