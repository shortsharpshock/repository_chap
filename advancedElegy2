// advanced elegy for the governing body of jehovah's witnesses

your god is a middle manager 
too cowardly to even don a pinstripe. 
he keeps his angels
relegated to their cubes.
heaven is an office complex
slated for redevelopment. heaven is a poisoned 
building in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood. 
and god wants to save you 
from burnout. really, he does. it's just the projects 
are piling up and heaven is redefining 
cloud-based architecture. the phones are fried
from recent complaints. he's trying to avoid 
scope creep. god's greatest excuse is always
that he has a boss too but you know 
he's lying. you hear the other men 
who flank his office say your works are fine
but his eye is finer. it's nearly noble
that you're trying. here's a secret: your god's 
boss is retired and god is tired
of feeling like his hands are tied
around your neck.
