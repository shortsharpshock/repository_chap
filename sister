I am scared, you know, to go back to the place that starved the sister out of us.
I'm only half a chapel without you. You know, I memorized your number from a generic people search.
I Google you, every so often. 
I hope your sons get to be brothers.
Twin pews, or at least adjacent ones.
I want the god they took from us, Neka.
I want the god I can capitalize.
There's a cop at this poetry reading, Neka,
nodding her head like your husband would've, off-duty, watching the film that made him love film.
God is a film that captures everything and they reduced him to a megachurch play.
God is a grieving hand and they want to hold you like they hold me now. 
Are you friends? They haven't told me much about you, lately.
Listen, Neka--there are men who will emaciate your whole life if you let them.
There are men dangling windowless churches full of half-built children.
Neka, I was willing to sing both parts of the cycle if it meant you got to live.
I didn't give anything for you and I'm ashamed. 
You are still the song my throat remembers.
I was named for an absent sister but you were named for a fondly remembered young love.
You were my first lesson in apology, in hurt. 
You were the splinters in my teeth and I was happy to bleed with you, with sorries on my lips, knocking on your door.
You opened it.
