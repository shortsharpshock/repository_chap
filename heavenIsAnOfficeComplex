your god is a middle manager 
too cowardly to even don a pinstripe. 
he keeps his angels
relegated to their cubes.
heaven is an office complex
slated for redevelopment. heaven is a poisoned 
building in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood. 
and god wants to save you 
from burnout. really, he does. it's just the projects 
are piling up and heaven is redefining 
cloud-based architecture. he's trying to avoid 
scope creep. god's excuse is always
that he has a boss too but you know 
he's lying. you hear the men 
who flank his office say your works are fine
but his eye is finer. here's a secret: god's boss 
is retired and god is tired
of feeling like his hands are tied
around your neck.
